# Exercism

The primary goal of Exercism is to help people become fluent in their programming language of choice. Exercism help you become more fluent in a programming language by solving exercises.

There are over 50 programming languages to choose from, with tons of variety. To start learning a programming language, first find the language you want to learn on the tracks page.

Once you've decided upon a language, go to its track page and join the track. After having joined a track, you'll immediately be able to start solving exercises.

By completing exercises (meaning: writing an implementation that passes all the tests) you'll get access to even more exercises, improving your fluency as you go. The unlocking exercises page has more information on how to unlock exercises.

If you're ever stuck on an exercise, you can request help from a mentor. A mentor will then engage in a conversation with you to help you get unstuck.

Have fun learning!
